# Physics-Constrained Neural Models for Agent-Based Trajectory Prediction

## Technical Overview and Comparative Analysis

## 1. Introduction to Physics-Constrained Modeling

### Problem Statement

Traditional neural networks can produce predictions that violate physical laws or domain constraints. In agent-based modeling (ABM) for spatial movement, agents must respect graph connectivity - they cannot teleport between non-adjacent zones. Physics-constrained models ensure predictions remain physically plausible.

### Constraint Types

| Constraint Type | Enforcement | Training Impact | Inference Guarantees |
|----------------|-------------|-----------------|---------------------|
| **Soft Constraints** | Penalty terms in loss | Gradual learning | Probabilistic compliance |
| **Hard Constraints** | Architectural masking | Direct enforcement | Guaranteed compliance |
| **Hybrid Constraints** | Combined approach | Flexible learning | Configurable guarantees |

### Mathematical Foundation

Given a graph G = (V, E) with adjacency matrix A, the constraint for valid transitions is:

```
∀ transitions (zi, zi+1): A[zi, zi+1] = 1
```

Where zi represents the zone at time step i.

## 2. Model Architectures

### 2.1 PhysicsInformedODE

**Theoretical Foundation:** Continuous dynamics with physics-informed neural ODEs

**Mathematical Framework:**
```
dx/dt = f(x, t, θ) where f respects physics constraints
x(t) represents continuous position in embedding space
Zone embeddings act as "attractors" in the space
```

**Architecture Components:**

| Component | Dimension | Purpose |
|-----------|-----------|---------|
| Zone Embeddings | 8 × 64 | Learnable attractors in embedding space |
| Time Encoder | 1 → 16 → 16 | Temporal feature encoding |
| Person Encoder | 8 → 64 → 64 | Agent characteristic encoding |
| Flow Network | 144 → 64 → 32 → 64 | Velocity field prediction |
| Zone Predictor | 64 → 8 | Embedding to zone mapping |

**Constraint Mechanism:**
- **Velocity Projection:** Desired velocity is projected onto allowed directions
- **Adjacency-Based Flow:** Only allows movement along graph edges
- **Continuous Enforcement:** Physics constraints applied at every ODE step

**Mathematical Formulation:**
```
v_desired = FlowNet(pos, person, time)
v_allowed = {unit vectors to adjacent zones}
v_constrained = Σ softmax(v_desired · v_i) * v_i
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ Theoretically elegant continuous dynamics

- ✅ Interpretable as physical system

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ Computationally expensive (ODE solving)
- ⚠️ Complex architecture with many components
- ⚠️ Requires careful tuning of ODE solver parameters
- ⚠️ May be overkill for discrete zone predictions

---

### 2.2 SmoothTrajectoryPredictor

**Theoretical Foundation:** ODE wrapper with trajectory smoothing

**Process Flow:**
1. **Initial Position:** Predict starting zone from person attributes
2. **ODE Integration:** Solve continuous dynamics over time
3. **Zone Assignment:** Convert continuous trajectory to discrete zones
4. **Fallback Mechanism:** Linear interpolation if ODE fails

**Mathematical Details:**
```
trajectory = odeint(PhysicsODE, initial_state, times)
zone_logits = -distances(trajectory, zone_embeddings) * temperature
```

**Pros:**

### 2.3 SimplifiedDiffusionModel

**Theoretical Foundation:** Soft constraint enforcement via penalty terms

**Philosophy:** Learn physics compliance through gradient-based optimization with penalties

**Architecture:**
```
Input: person_attrs + time → [8 + 1] = 9 dimensions
Hidden: 9 → 128 → 64 → 8 zones
Constraint: Soft penalty for invalid transitions
```

| Layer | Input → Output | Activation | Purpose |
|-------|----------------|------------|---------|
| Input Layer | 9 → 128 | ReLU | Feature expansion |
| Hidden Layer | 128 → 64 | ReLU | Representation learning |
| Output Layer | 64 → 8 | None | Zone logits |

**Constraint Implementation:**
```python
penalty = 10.0  # Hyperparameter
constrained_logits = raw_logits - penalty * (1 - adjacency_row)
```

**Learning Dynamics:**
- **Gradient Flow:** Penalties guide learning away from violations
- **Soft Boundaries:** Model can temporarily violate constraints during training
- **Convergence:** Eventually learns to respect constraints

**Mathematical Formulation:**
```
L_total = L_prediction + λ * L_physics
L_physics = Σ max(0, logit_i) for invalid transitions i
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ Simple and interpretable architecture
- ✅ Lightweight (10,056 parameters)
- ✅ Fast training and inference
- ✅ Preserves gradient flow
- ✅ Flexible constraint strength tuning

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ No guarantee of constraint satisfaction
- ⚠️ May require careful penalty tuning
- ⚠️ Can learn to ignore constraints if poorly tuned
- ⚠️ Soft compliance only

### 2.4 ImprovedStrictPhysicsModel

**Theoretical Foundation:** Hard constraint enforcement via architectural masking

**Philosophy:** Guarantee physics compliance by making violations architecturally impossible

**Architecture Enhancements:**
```
Input: person_attrs + time + current_zone_onehot → [8 + 1 + 8] = 17 dimensions
Enhanced: LayerNorm + Residual connections + Dropout
Output: Masked logits with -inf for invalid transitions
```

| Component | Configuration | Purpose |
|-----------|---------------|---------|
| Input Normalization | LayerNorm(17) | Stable training |
| Encoder 1 | 17 → 256 + LayerNorm + ReLU + Dropout(0.2) | Feature extraction |
| Encoder 2 | 256 → 128 + LayerNorm + ReLU + Dropout(0.2) | Representation learning |
| Output | 128 → 64 → 8 + LayerNorm + ReLU + Dropout(0.1) | Zone prediction |

**Constraint Mechanism:**
```python
# Hard masking with -inf
masked_logits = raw_logits.clone()
invalid_indices = (adjacency_row == 0)
masked_logits[invalid_indices] = float('-inf')
```

**Mathematical Properties:**
```
P(invalid_transition) = 0  (exactly)
∇L flows only through valid transitions
softmax(-inf) = 0  (guaranteed)
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ **Guaranteed** physics compliance
- ✅ Mathematically rigorous constraint enforcement
- ✅ No hyperparameter tuning for constraints
- ✅ Robust architecture with normalization

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ Largest model (47,210 parameters)
- ⚠️ Reduced gradient flow (only through valid paths)
- ⚠️ May be harder to optimize
- ⚠️ Inflexible - cannot adapt constraint strength

### 2.5 HybridPhysicsModel

**Theoretical Foundation:** Dual-mode operation with training/inference switching

**Philosophy:** Best of both worlds - soft training for learning, hard inference for guarantees

**Dual Architecture:**
```
Training Mode: Soft penalties (preserves gradients)
Inference Mode: Hard masking (guarantees compliance)
```

**Mode-Dependent Processing:**

| Mode | Constraint Type | Logit Processing | Gradient Flow |
|------|----------------|------------------|---------------|
| Training | Soft penalty | `logits - penalty * (1 - adjacency)` | Full |
| Inference | Hard masking | `logits[invalid] = -inf` | N/A |

**Architecture:**
```python
def forward(self, person_attrs, times, zone_features, edge_index, training=True):
    raw_logits = self.path_generator(input_vec)
    
    if training:
        # Soft constraints for learning
        constrained_logits = raw_logits - penalty * (1 - adjacency_row)
    else:
        # Hard constraints for guarantee
        constrained_logits = hard_mask(raw_logits, adjacency_row)
```

**Learning Strategy:**
1. **Training Phase:** Model learns patterns with soft guidance
2. **Transition:** Gradual shift from soft to hard (optional)
3. **Inference Phase:** Hard constraints ensure compliance

**Pros:**
- ✅ Combines advantages of both approaches
- ✅ Guaranteed inference compliance
- ✅ Flexible training with good gradients
- ✅ Lightweight architecture (10,056 parameters)
- ✅ Mode-specific optimization

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ Training/inference discrepancy

### 2.6 CurriculumPhysicsModel

**Theoretical Foundation:** Progressive constraint hardening during training

**Philosophy:** Gradually increase constraint strength to ease optimization

**Curriculum Schedule:**
```python
penalty = 1.0 + (100.0 - 1.0) * (training_step / total_steps)
# Penalty grows: 1.0 → 100.0 over training
```

**Mathematical Formulation:**
```
t = training_step / total_steps
α(t) = α_min + (α_max - α_min) * t
L_constrained = raw_logits - α(t) * (1 - adjacency)
```

**Training Phases:**

| Phase | Training Progress | Penalty Strength | Learning Focus |
|-------|------------------|------------------|----------------|
| Early | 0% - 25% | 1.0 - 25.75 | Pattern learning |
| Middle | 25% - 75% | 25.75 - 75.25 | Constraint awareness |
| Late | 75% - 100% | 75.25 - 100.0 | Strict compliance |

**Progressive Learning Benefits:**
1. **Early Training:** Model learns basic patterns without constraint pressure
2. **Middle Training:** Gradual constraint introduction
3. **Late Training:** Strong constraint enforcement

**Pros:**
- ✅ Pedagogically principled approach
- ✅ Easier optimization than direct hard constraints
- ✅ Automatic constraint strength scheduling

```
Soft Model: SimplifiedDiffusionModel (10,056 params)
Hard Model: ImprovedStrictPhysicsModel (47,210 params)
Combination: Learned weighted average (2 params)
Total: 57,268 parameters
```

**Combination Mechanism:**
```python
soft_logits, _ = self.soft_model(inputs)
hard_logits, _ = self.hard_model(inputs)

# Handle -inf values from hard model
hard_logits_clean = hard_logits.clone()
hard_logits_clean[torch.isinf(hard_logits_clean)] = -100.0

# Learned weighted combination
weights = torch.softmax(self.combination_weights, dim=0)
combined_logits = weights[0] * soft_logits + weights[1] * hard_logits_clean
```

**Learning Dynamics:**
- **Initialization:** Start with soft model preference (0.7, 0.3)
- **Training:** Learn optimal combination through backpropagation
- **Adaptation:** Weights adjust based on performance

**Mathematical Properties:**
```
Output = σ(w₁) * Soft_Output + σ(w₂) * Hard_Output
∇w depends on relative model performance
Combines diverse prediction strategies
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ Leverages multiple approaches
- ✅ Automatically learns combination weights
- ✅ Robust to individual model failures
